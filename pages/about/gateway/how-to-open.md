About this document
-------------------

This document describes the process required to “open” a Gateway
Language. This document assumes a working knowledge of the 
[Gateway Language Strategy]({{ '/gateway' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) as well as our multi-tiered approach to [checking of translated biblical content]({{ '/quality' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). The basic structure of
this document is first to address the overview of the process, then
describe the flowcharts for each aspect of the process, then synthesize
all of the component pieces at the end.

This document is the result of input from many people and countless
hours of research, development, trial and error, and testing of new
tools and strategies. It should be considered a work in progress, and
the current version will always be available online.



The Flow of Content through a Gateway Language
----------------------------------------------

![The Flow of Content through a Gateway Language]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.004.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This illustrates how the various pieces of content (including sources,
explanatory resources, and tools/metadata for apps and printing) flow
from English to each Gateway Language (GL). The unfoldingWord network is
“pushing” the content outward to each GL, where a team comprised of
various Church networks receives (“pulls”) the content from English into
the GL where it can be “pulled” by the Church in people groups behind
the GLs into any/all minority languages.

Note that this procedural overview should not be confused with the
process for translation *from* the GLs into the minority languages
behind them. That process is significantly different and is beyond the
scope of what is addressed here.


Conceptual Overview
-------------------

![Conceptual Overview]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.006.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

There are five core aspects of opening a Gateway Language, each of which
is addressed in greater detail below:

-   [Preparation](#preparation) — before translation of content can happen, the translators must be identified, equipped, trained, and aligned.
-   [translationAcademy](#translationacademy) — once a team has been established, core elements of the translationAcademy pertaining to principles and procedures of translation and checking of translated biblical content are translated.
-   [Open Bible Stories + tools, metadata](#open-bible-stories--tools-metadata) — next, the Open Bible Stories text and translationNotes are translated into the GL, together with the essential metadata and text for the translation software tools.
-   [Bible](#bible) — the Bible source texts, exegetical resources and translation helps are translated.
-   [Print + Media](#print--media) — production capacity for printing and recording of biblical content in audio (and other media) formats is provided. 
  

Preparation
-----------

![Preparation]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.008.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The first step is to identify the Church networks that agree with our
Statement of Faith, Translation Guidelines, use of an Open License, and
our strategy. Eventually, we will need three networks, in order to clear
the Level 3 checking requirement. *Note that all contributors need to
sign a license releasing all their contributions under CC BY-SA 4.0. At
least the human-readable license will need to be translated into the
Gateway Language at this point, and the whole license will be needed
eventually.*

These Church networks need to have translators who have adequate command
of English as a second language. If not, consider using an ELL training
program to improve their English capacity, as almost all source content
(except for potential open-licensed/public domain Bible translations in
the GL) is in English.

Next, they need to have adequate translation capacity (or it needs to be
provided). The checkers need to be trained in our checking process and
level system. This is explained in detail in the (forthcoming) Checking
Manual, part of translationAcademy.

The translators need adequate technical capacity to use the various
technology tools (or they need a technical assistance team that can be
so trained). They need adequate production capacity, in terms of
available people, time, and financial resources. If not, like-minded 
businesses may be able to help establish a platform to increase their 
capacity.

They need adequate Internet connectivity and ability to use various
communication tools (e.g. Hall, video conferencing, web-based project
management software, etc.). Like-minded technology ministries may be able to 
help provide connectivity solutions if none are readily available.

Finally, a tactical workflow must be developed and the team trained in
how to use the tools in it to accomplish the desired outcomes in the
most efficient manner possible.


translationAcademy
------------------

![Preparation]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.010.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The [translationAcademy](/academy) is in active development and
is comprised of three primary sections: Translation Manual, Checking
Manual, and Technology Manual. Each of these sections contain “core
modules” that together comprise the “translationAcademy Handbook”. In
the first pass through the translation of translationAcademy modules,
all the modules in this guide should be translated and checked to at
least Level 2.

Voice assets in the GL should be identified and the training resources
recorded as audio files, for use by primarily oral translators. *Note:
depending on the context, it may be necessary to jump to the* *“audio
track” of the “printing + media” section.*

All content, text and audio, needs to be uploaded to the Door43 server
where the translators should verify that spelling, formatting, layout,
etc. are all correct. Once it’s ready to go, they should generate an
unfoldingWord publishing request (<http://ufw.io/publish>) so that the
resources can be digitally published and made available online and in
translationStudio.

In the second pass through the translationAcademy, the same process
should be followed for all the supporting modules in tA. This second
pass must take place after the translations of the Bible in the GL are
finished, so that the Bible translations can be incorporated into the
modules that require Bible text for examples.


Open Bible Stories + tools, metadata
------------------------------------

![OBS + tools, metadata]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.012.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

In this phase, the Open Bible Stories text and corresponding
translationNotes content (including the exegetical notes, important
words, and comprehension questions) are translated into the Gateway
Language. *Note that it is recommended that the translators translate
all the resources (text + notes) one story at a time, rather than doing
all of the OBS text and then proceeding to the translationNotes (even
though the flowchart seems to suggest that). The reason for this is it
will likely require less work, as the translation team can make
adjustments to the translation of the text and notes as they proceed,
rather than needing to make adjustments to the text after they have
completed it, based on the translation of the Notes.*

The translated OBS text must be checked to Level 3 and the
translationNotes must be checked to at least Level 2.

The tools and metadata also should be translated at this point in the
process. This includes the words used in the translationStudio app, as
well as the CC BY-SA 4.0 License, the Statement of Faith, Translation
Guidelines, and other important content.

Once all translated content has been uploaded to Door43, the translators
should do a final “pre-flight check” that everything is checked
appropriately, located in the correct place, spelled correctly, and
ready for publishing. Once everything is ready, they should generate an
unfoldingWord publishing request. This will start the publishing process
that transfers content from Door43 into the unfoldingWord catalog where
it is available for translation via translationStudio.

* * * * *

**CONGRATULATIONS!** At this point, the Gateway Language is officially open
for translation and Church-centric checking of biblical content (Open
Bible Stories) in every language on the other side of the Gateway
Language. We are most of the way there!

Bible
-----

![Bible]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.014.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Whenever a translator is translating from a translation and does not
have adequate ability with the original biblical languages, the
resulting translation can tend to skew farther than it should from the
original. In order to minimize this, it is better to translate from two
translations concurrently: one that preserves important elements of the
*form* of the original (i.e. a more “literal” translation) and one that
clarifies the *function* of the original (i.e. a more “dynamic” or
“meaning-based” translation).

The first step is to identify if an adequate unrestricted Literal Bible
*and* an adequate unrestricted Dynamic Bible exists in the Gateway
Language, by which is meant:

-   **adequate** — the Bible text should be in a structured digital format 
    (USFM or USX is ideal) and the translation itself should be of good 
    quality, reputable, and well-regarded by the Church.
-   **unrestricted** — the most common scenario is likely to involve 
    identifying an older Bible translation in the public domain (though not 
    all of them are necessarily adequate). Do not use a translation under the 
    assumption it is in the clear—check with Translation Services first! 
    Otherwise, a Bible translation must be procured under Creative Commons 
    Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0. 

If adequate literal and dynamic Bible translations are not available,
the unfoldingWord Literal Bible (ULB) and unfoldingWord Dynamic Bible
(UDB) should be translated and checked to Level 3. Then the
translationNotes for each book of the Bible should be translated and
adapted to the translations and then checked to Level 3. Once all the
text and notes have been uploaded to Door43 and checked for formatting
and spelling, an unfoldingWord publishing request should be generated.

* * * * *

**CONGRATULATIONS!** For every book of the Bible completed to this point,
the Gateway Language is now open for translation and Church-centric
checking of the Bible in every language on the other side.

Print + Media
-------------

![Bible]({{ '/assets/img/gateway/gl-open.016.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

After biblical content has been adequately checked (Level 3, for Gateway
Languages), the content needs to be made available in print and media
formats, especially audio. If adequate tools and training for
high-quality audio recording is already available to the Gateway
Languages translation team, they can proceed directly to recording audio
formats of the biblical content. If they do not have what they need for
audio recording, this must first be provided. Once complete (and checked
for adequate audio quality), the recording can be uploaded to Door43
where they will be made available in the unfoldingWord media catalog.

In the print track, the first step is to identify if existing publishers
are willing to print the finished translations of the biblical content
translated into the Gateway Language. If so, arrangements should be made
to publish the biblical content.

If not, print-on-demand technology may provide an affordable solution.
If existing print-on-demand infrastructure is in place and can meet the
demand, it should be pursued as a publishing platform. If not, a
print-on-demand publishing platform should be developed in order to
publish the needed biblical content.
