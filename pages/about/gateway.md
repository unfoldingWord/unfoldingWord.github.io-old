## The Gateway Languages List

*Revision: {{ site.data.assets.gateway-langs-pdf.rev }}*

Currently, there are **41** known gateway languages. Additional information about Gateway Languages is available [here][gl-about]. Note that, due to their different characteristics, Sign Languages are not covered in this strategy. Research is still [ongoing](#ongoing-research) to determine the complete number of gateway languages. Please [contact us][contact] if you have updated information.
Thank you!

The current map and additional information is available in these formats
(revision **{{ site.data.assets.gateway-langs-pdf.rev }}**):

## Ongoing Research

The identification of the gateway languages is an ongoing research project.
Known areas where input is needed include:

### South Asia:

- Are any of the gateway languages listed for India unnecessary?
- Should any languages be added to the list to cover all of India, including
    any of the following (also official languages in India): Konkani (koi),
    Manipuri (mmi), Khasi (kha), Mizo (lus), Lotha (njh)?

### Eurasia:

- What languages have Dominant Culture Variants (see the
    [glossary][glossary])?
- What are the gateway languages in Eastern European countries?
- What are the gateway languages in the following countries: Turkmenistan, 
    Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan?
- For each of these countries, what are the sociolinguistic implications of
    using Russian as a gateway language, given the historical and political
    connotations?
- What are the gateway languages used in Afghanistan? Should Pashto be considered a gateway language in Afghanistan?
- Is Kurdish a gateway language for any people groups speaking minority
    languages in Central Asia (or elsewhere)?

### Pacific:

- How many gateway languages are in use in Indonesia?
