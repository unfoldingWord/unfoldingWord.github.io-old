The Unlocked Dynamic Bible is an open-licensed version of the Bible that is intended to provide a "functional" understanding of the Bible. It attempts to increase the translator's understanding of the text by translating theological terms as descriptive phrases.

The Unlocked Dynamic Bible is intended to be used together with the [Unlocked Literal Bible][ulb] to provide a more robust view of both the form and function of the original texts.
