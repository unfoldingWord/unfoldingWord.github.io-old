*The following statement on the principles and procedures used in
translation is subscribed to by all member organizations of and
contributors to the [unfoldingWord]({{ '/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) project. All translation
activities are carried out according to these common guidelines.*

1.  **Accurate** — Translate accurately, without detracting from,
    changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated
    content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the
    meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the
    original audience.
2.  **Clear** — Use whatever language structures are necessary to
    achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes
    rearranging the form of a text and using as many or as few terms as
    necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as
    possible.
3.  **Faithful** — Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of
    the original biblical languages. Terms addressing the relationship
    between God the Father and God the Son should be retained in
    translated content and clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other
    supplemental resources.
4.  **Authoritative** — Use the original language biblical texts as the
    highest authority for translation of biblical content. Reliable
    biblical content in other languages may be used for clarification
    and as intermediary source texts.
5.  **Pure** — Avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social,
    cultural, or theological bias in your translation.
6.  **Expressive** — Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the
    original text. As much as possible, maintain the literary forms in
    the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and
    prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that
    communicate in a similar way in your language.
7.  **Historical** — Communicate historical events and facts accurately,
    providing additional information as needed in order to accurately
    communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same
    context and culture as the original recipients of the original
    content.
8.  **Natural** — Use language forms that are effective and that reflect
    the way your language is used in corresponding contexts.
9.  **Collaborative** — Where possible, work together with other
    believers who speak your language to translate, check, and
    distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the
    highest quality and available to as many people as possible.
10. **Ongoing** — Encourage the periodic review of translations to
    ascertain when revision or a new translation is needed.

Managing and Identifying Translation Quality
--------------------------------------------

The quality of a translation generally refers to the fidelity of the
translation to the meaning of the original, and the degree to which the
translation is understandable and effective for the speakers of the
receptor language. The strategy we suggest involves checking the forms
and communicative quality of the translation with the language
community, and checking the fidelity of the translation with the Church
in that people group.

The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the
language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider
a good translation to be one that is:

1.  **Accurate** – Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as
    determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with
    the Church global and historical, and consequently:
2.  **Affirmed by the Church** – Endorsed and used by the Church.

In addition, a good translation is reviewed by the speakers of the
language community and is found to be:

1.  **Natural** – Using current forms of the language, and
2.  **Clear** – Strives for the highest level of comprehension by
    hearers.
