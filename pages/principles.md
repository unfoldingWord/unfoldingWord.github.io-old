Every Language
--------------

We create Biblical content and technology tools that are effective for
every language, without exception. If we design a tool or resource that
is not able to go the distance to the heart language of the last and
smallest people group, we have not yet designed it correctly.

> And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth
> has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all people
> groups, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
> the Holy Spirit” —Matthew 28:19

Excellence
----------

The unfoldingWord project is built on a firm commitment to the faithful
and accurate communication of God’s Word. The degree of rigor involved
in the checking process of each work is clearly indicated with the
intent that ongoing review and checking will iteratively increase the
excellence of each work.

> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who
> has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. —2
> Timothy 2:15

Always Open
-----------

Everything we create, whether Biblical content or technology tools, is
made available under a license that proactively grants the entire Church
unrestricted freedom to use and build on it, without requiring
additional permission.

> Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul,
> and… they had everything in common. —Acts 4:32

Unstoppable
-----------

Our strategies and technical frameworks are intentionally designed to
encourage and enable massive redistribution of Biblical content by the
entire global Church, in and to every people group. We avoid single
points of failure and centralized structures by using parallel,
redundant, and distributed technologies.

> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could
> number, from every people group, from all tribes and peoples and
> languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in
> white robes, with palm branches in their hands. —Revelation 7:9
